    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      Protecting your personal data is important to us. Therefore, we process
      any data exclusively in accordance with applicable legal regulations
      (GDPR, TMG). This privacy policy outlines the key aspects of data handling
      on the OpenPSG website.
    </p>

    <h2>1. General Information</h2>
    OpenPSG does not use cookies and does not collect any personal data beyond
    what is technically necessary to operate the website.
    <p></p>

    <h2>2. Collection and Processing of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
      No personal data is stored or processed when you visit OpenPSG, except for
      minimal technical data required to ensure the basic functionality and
      security of the website (e.g., your IP address). These are automatically
      handled by the server and deleted after the session ends.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>
      Any processing of technical data is done solely on the basis of legal
      regulations, particularly Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR (legitimate
      interest). Our legitimate interest lies in the secure, stable, and
      efficient delivery of our website.
    </p>

    <h2>4. No Disclosure of Data to Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share personal data with third parties. Your data is not
      transferred to third countries.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your
      data against unauthorized access, alteration, or loss. However, complete
      security cannot be guaranteed due to the nature of the internet.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      You have the right to request information about any personal data we may
      have about you, as well as the right to rectification, deletion, or
      restriction of processing. You may also object to data processing based on
      legitimate interest.
    </p>
