# OpenPSG

## Notes

This tool will only work on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Android. It will
not work on Firefox, Safari, or any other browser.

On Linux you'll need to explicitly enable the Web Bluetooth API in your
browser settings. This is still an experimental feature due to historical
issues with the Linux Bluetooth stack. If you are running an up-to-date
Linux install you'll be totally fine to turn it on!
